This is the readme for TutorAmigo program designed by Aayush Kafle for Lobo Hackathon 
2024 at UNM RainForest. 

This program is designed so that students can connect with other students
at the University who might have taken the class they are currently charged. These students
can ask for help from previous students which might include things such as peer-to-peer 
tutoring, notes, potential question, etc. 

Within the application, a single user will be able to add classes they have taken so that 
they get help requests from other users within the university. That user may decide to charge 
a fee for their help, or can volunteer within the program to earn points which can be used 
to redeem discounts for school supplies at UNM BookStore.
